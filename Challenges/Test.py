# Script Name:                  Ops 18 Automated Brute Force Wordlist Attack Tool Part 3 of 3
# Author:                       Juan Miguel Cano
# Date of latest revision:      01/31/2024      
# Purpose:                      Provides four modes for interacting with a word list file, allowing users to
# Purpose cont:                 either iterate through the list with delays (simulating a dictionary attack), 
# Purpose cont:                 search for specific words within the list, authenticate to an SSH server by its IP address,
# Purpose cont:                 or perform a brute force attack on a password-locked zip file.
