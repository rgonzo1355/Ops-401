# Logging and Monitoring: Introduction to AWS CloudWatch

## Reading and Discussion Points

### CloudWatch Events
**Explain CloudWatch Events to a non-technical friend.**
- CloudWatch Events are like the notifications or alerts you set up on your phone. Imagine you want to know when your favorite band is performing in your city. You can create an alert that tells you whenever they announce a concert nearby. CloudWatch Events work similarly, but for your cloud resources. They can notify you when something important happens in your cloud environment, like a server going down or a new instance being launched.

### CloudWatch Logs
**What do CloudWatch Logs help us achieve?**
- CloudWatch Logs are like a diary for your cloud resources. They help us keep a record of what's happening with our applications and servers. It's like having a log of all the activities, errors, and events, so if something goes wrong, we can go back and see what happened. They are great for troubleshooting and monitoring our cloud applications.

### CloudWatch Anomaly Detection
**What capabilities does CloudWatch Anomaly detection have?**
- CloudWatch Anomaly detection is like having a super-smart assistant. It can automatically learn the normal behavior of your resources, like how much traffic your website gets on a typical day. Then, if something unusual happens, like a sudden spike in traffic, it will alert you. It's like having someone who can spot odd patterns and tell you when something doesn't seem right.
