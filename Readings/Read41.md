# Reconnaissance

## Reading

### What is penetration testing?
Penetration testing is a simulated cyber attack against a computer system, network, or application to identify vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. It involves identifying security weaknesses and assessing the effectiveness of security measures.

### How are the stages of a pen test similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?
The stages of a penetration test are similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain, a framework used to describe the phases of a cyber attack. Both involve reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. In penetration testing, each stage is systematically executed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, similar to how an attacker progresses through the Cyber Kill Chain to achieve their objectives.

### Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the company's leadership. How would you lead this conversation?
- **Identify weaknesses:** Penetration testing helps identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's systems, networks, and applications before attackers can exploit them.
- **Improve security posture:** By proactively discovering vulnerabilities and addressing them, the company can strengthen its overall security posture and reduce the risk of successful cyber attacks.
- **Compliance requirements:** Many regulatory standards and industry frameworks require regular penetration testing for compliance efforts. Conducting pen tests helps ensure that the company meets regulatory requirements and industry best practices.
- **Risk management:** Penetration testing provides valuable insights into the organization's security risks, allowing leadership to prioritize and allocate resources effectively to mitigate those risks.
- **Build trust:** Regular penetration testing demonstrates the company's commitment to security and helps build trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders by assuring them that their data is protected.
