# Threat Hunting with Security Onion

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Difference Between Threat Hunting and Pentesting
**How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?**
- Threat Hunting and Pentesting serve different purposes in cybersecurity. Pentesting, short for penetration testing, involves simulating cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems or networks. On the other hand, Threat Hunting is a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating threats that may have evaded traditional security measures. While Pentesting focuses on finding vulnerabilities, Threat Hunting focuses on detecting and responding to active threats.

### Primary Objective of Threat Hunting
**What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?**
- The primary objective of Threat Hunting is to proactively search for signs of malicious activity or security breaches within an organization's environment. Instead of waiting for alerts or incidents to occur, Threat Hunting involves actively searching for indicators of compromise (IOCs), suspicious behaviors, or anomalies that may indicate the presence of a threat actor.

### Advocating for Threat Hunting Activities
**Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but is not actively threat-hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?**
-- - I recommend starting threat-hunting activities by emphasizing the limitations of relying solely on reactive security measures, such as the SOC. While the SOC is essential for incident response, Threat Hunting adds a proactive layer of defense by actively seeking out threats before they manifest into security incidents. I highlight the benefits of Threat Hunting, such as early detection of advanced threats, reducing dwell time, and enhancing overall security posture. Additionally, I would showcase success stories and case studies from organizations that have implemented Threat Hunting programs to demonstrate their effectiveness in improving cybersecurity defenses.
