# Exploitation with Metasploit

## Reading

### What is Metasploit?
Metasploit is a powerful and widely-used penetration testing framework that helps security professionals assess and exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. 

### Explain what Metasploit is using non-technical terms.
Think of Metasploit as a toolbox filled with various tools that hackers and security professionals use to find weaknesses in computer systems. Just like a locksmith's toolkit helps them open locks, Metasploit helps cybersecurity experts test and secure computer systems by simulating attacks and identifying vulnerabilities before real attackers can exploit them.
