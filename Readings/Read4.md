# Systems Hardening with CIS Standards

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Benefits of Following CIS Benchmarks
**What are three benefits of following CIS Benchmarks?**
1. **Enhanced Security Posture:** By implementing CIS Benchmarks, organizations can significantly improve their security defenses. The benchmarks provide comprehensive guidelines for securing systems and networks, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities and protecting against various cyber threats.
2. **Compliance Readiness:** CIS Benchmarks align closely with many regulatory and industry standards. By adhering to these benchmarks, organizations can simplify their compliance processes with various regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others, ensuring they meet necessary security requirements.
3. **Community-Driven Best Practices:** The development of CIS Benchmarks involves a consensus-driven process with input from a broad community of cybersecurity professionals. This collaboration ensures that the benchmarks are up-to-date, practical, and effective in addressing current security challenges and emerging threats.


### Core Categories of CIS Benchmarks
**What are the seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks?**
1. **Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets:** Tracking and managing all hardware devices that have access to the corporate network, to minimize the risk of unauthorized devices.
2. **Inventory and Control of Software Assets:** Managing all software used in the organization, ensuring only authorized software is installed and used.
3. **Continuous Vulnerability Management:** Regularly identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in software and hardware.
4. **Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges:** Strict management of user accounts with special access or administrative privileges to prevent misuse.
5. **Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software:** Ensuring that all IT systems are securely configured to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and attacks.
6. **Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs:** Regularly reviewing and analyzing audit logs to detect and respond to potential security incidents promptly.
7. **Additional categories covering various aspects of IT security:** This includes other important security measures like data protection, incident response planning, and network security controls.


### Convincing Management about CIS Benchmarks
**How would you convince your manager that applying CIS Benchmarks could fast-track your organizationâ€™s compliance?**
- Highlighting the alignment of CIS Benchmarks with regulatory requirements, the reduction in cybersecurity risks, and the efficiency gained in securing IT systems. Demonstrating how these benchmarks can streamline processes and provide a clear framework for security best practices.

## Case Study: ACME Gets Poison Ivy
**What were the key failures in the ACME Inc. Poison Ivy case study?**
- The key failures included a lack of network access control for personal devices, an outdated malicious site list, insufficient malware protection on personal devices, and a delayed incident response.

## CIS Controls Overview
**How are CIS controls structured in version 7.1?**
- CIS controls in version 7.1 are divided into three groups: Basic, Foundational, and Organizational Controls, each targeting different aspects of IT security from essential measures to more advanced security strategies.

## Additional Topics
**How do CIS Benchmarks support regulatory compliance?**
- CIS Benchmarks align with many regulatory standards, providing a solid foundation for meeting compliance requirements in various industries.
