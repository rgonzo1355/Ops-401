# Systems Hardening with CIS Standards

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Benefits of Following CIS Benchmarks
**What are three benefits of following CIS Benchmarks?**
- Enhanced Security Posture: Implementing CIS Benchmarks helps in significantly improving the overall security of IT systems by reducing vulnerabilities.
- Compliance Readiness: Many regulatory frameworks align with CIS standards, making compliance easier to achieve and maintain.
- Community-Driven Best Practices: CIS Benchmarks are developed through a consensus-driven process involving cybersecurity experts, ensuring up-to-date and effective security measures.

### Core Categories of CIS Benchmarks
**What are the seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks?**
- The seven core categories are Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets, Inventory and Control of Software Assets, Continuous Vulnerability Management, Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges, Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software, Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs, and additional categories covering various aspects of IT security.

### Convincing Management about CIS Benchmarks
**How would you convince your manager that applying CIS Benchmarks could fast-track your organizationâ€™s compliance?**
- Highlighting the alignment of CIS Benchmarks with regulatory requirements, the reduction in cybersecurity risks, and the efficiency gained in securing IT systems. Demonstrating how these benchmarks can streamline processes and provide a clear framework for security best practices.

## Case Study: ACME Gets Poison Ivy
**What were the key failures in the ACME Inc. Poison Ivy case study?**
- The key failures included a lack of network access control for personal devices, an outdated malicious site list, insufficient malware protection on personal devices, and a delayed incident response.

## CIS Controls Overview
**How are CIS controls structured in version 7.1?**
- CIS controls in version 7.1 are divided into three groups: Basic, Foundational, and Organizational Controls, each targeting different aspects of IT security from essential measures to more advanced security strategies.

## Additional Topics
**How do CIS Benchmarks support regulatory compliance?**
- CIS Benchmarks align with many regulatory standards, providing a solid foundation for meeting compliance requirements in various industries.
