# Cyber Threat Analyst and PowerShell-based Attacks

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Explaining the Role of a Cyber Threat Analyst
**You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst; how would you explain your role to a family member?**
- As a Cyber Threat Analyst, my job is like being a detective for the digital world. I investigate and analyze cyber threats and attacks to protect our organization's data and systems. I monitor for suspicious activities, analyze malware, and work to prevent cyberattacks before they happen. It's all about staying one step ahead of cybercriminals to keep our digital assets safe.

### PowerShell as an Effective Attack Vector
**Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector.**
- PowerShell is like a Swiss Army knife for hackers because it's built into Windows and has powerful scripting capabilities. Hackers can use PowerShell to execute commands, download malicious payloads, and evade traditional security controls. Its ability to run scripts directly in memory makes it harder to detect by antivirus software, and its integration with Windows systems gives attackers a wide range of tools to exploit vulnerabilities.

### Mitigating PowerShell-based Attacks
**What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?**
- To mitigate attacks leveraging PowerShell, you can:
  1. **Application Allowlisting:** Implement application allowlisting to restrict the execution of unauthorized PowerShell scripts. Only allow trusted scripts to run, reducing the attack surface for malicious scripts.
  2. **Implement Script Block Logging:** Enable PowerShell script block logging to capture and analyze all PowerShell commands executed on systems. This helps detect and investigate malicious activities, providing valuable insights into potential threats.
