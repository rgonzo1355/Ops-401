# Malware Analysis

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Malware Analyst Responsibilities
**You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.**
- As a Malware Analyst, my job is to dissect and understand malicious software, also known as malware. Imagine I'm like a detective investigating a crime scene in the digital world. I analyze suspicious files or programs to uncover how they work, what damage they can cause, and how to defend against them. By studying malware, I help protect computers and networks from cyber threats.

### Malware Analysis Process
**What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? What's a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?**
- The six steps of the Malware Analysis process are:
  1. **Acquisition**: Obtain the malware sample securely.
  2. **Examination**: Analyze the malware to understand its behavior and characteristics.
  3. **Identification**: Identify the type and purpose of the malware.
  4. **Containment**: Safely contain the malware to prevent further harm.
  5. **Eradication**: Remove the malware from infected systems.
  6. **Recovery**: Restore affected systems to a secure state.

  A good mnemonic to remember these steps is "AEICER," which stands for Acquisition, Examination, Identification, Containment, Eradication, and Recovery.

### Initial Malware Analysis
**You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?**
- The type of malware analysis conducted first is usually **Static Analysis**. This involves examining the malware without executing it. Static analysis provides initial insights into the malware's structure, characteristics, and potential behavior without risking infection or system harm. It includes examining file properties, code analysis, and identifying known indicators of compromise.
