### Discussion Points

1. **Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?**
   - **Confidentiality:** Implement strong encryption for data transmission, use multi-factor authentication for user access.
   - **Integrity:** Use checksums or hashing to verify the integrity of transaction data, implement secure and regular software updates.
   - **Availability:** Ensure redundancy in network connections and power supply, perform regular maintenance and monitoring of the ATM system.

2. **Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.**
   - Use of Encryption for protecting data confidentiality.
   - Regular Security Audits to maintain data integrity.
   - Implementing Redundancy and Failover Mechanisms to ensure data availability.

3. **What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?**
   - **Identification:** Identify potential risks that could affect the system.
   - **Assessment:** Evaluate the identified risks to determine their potential impact and likelihood.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement measures to reduce the impact or likelihood of these risks.
