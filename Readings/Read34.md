# Forensics Investigation with Autopsy

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Computer Forensics Overview
**What is Computer Forensics?**
- Computer Forensics is collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence to investigate and reconstruct events related to computer systems, networks, and digital devices. It involves applying investigative techniques and specialized tools to uncover and document evidence that can be used in legal proceedings or incident response.

### Differences Between Computer Forensics and Cybersecurity
**What are the main differences between computer forensics and Cybersecurity?**
- Computer Forensics investigates past incidents or events by analyzing digital evidence to uncover what happened, how it happened, and who was involved. It involves post-incident analysis and evidence collection for legal purposes. On the other hand, Cybersecurity focuses on preventing and mitigating security threats in real-time, implementing proactive measures to protect systems and networks from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyberattacks.

### Stages of a Computer Forensics Examination
**What are the six stages of a computer forensics examination?**
1. **Identification**: Determine the scope and objectives of the investigation and identify potential sources of evidence.
2. **Preservation**: Securely preserve the integrity of digital evidence to prevent tampering or alteration.
3. **Collection**: Gather digital evidence from various sources, such as computers, servers, storage devices, and network logs.
4. **Examination**: Analyze and process the collected evidence using specialized forensic tools and techniques.
5. **Analysis**: Interpret the findings from the examination phase to reconstruct events, identify patterns, and establish timelines.
6. **Presentation**: Document and present the findings clearly and concisely, suitable for legal proceedings or incident reports.
