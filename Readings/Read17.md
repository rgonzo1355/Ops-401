# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Three-Tier Architecture

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Key Features of the VPC Model
**What are some of the key features of the VPC model?**
- The key features of the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) model include:
  1. **Isolation:** VPCs provide network isolation, allowing you to create private network environments.
  2. **Control:** You have control over IP address ranges, subnets, and routing within your VPC.
  3. **Security:** VPCs offer security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
  4. **Scalability:** VPCs can be scaled to accommodate changing workloads and applications.

### Three-Tier Architecture Model
**What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?**
- The three tiers in the three-tier architecture model are:
  1. **Presentation Tier:** This tier handles user interaction and interface, often through a web application or user interface.
  2. **Application Tier:** The middle tier contains the application logic and business logic, processing user requests and managing data.
  3. **Data Tier:** The lowest tier is the data storage and database layer, where data is stored and retrieved.

### VPC vs. VPN
**Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.**
- A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like having your own private data center in the cloud. It allows you to create isolated networks, control network settings, and host resources securely in the cloud.
- On the other hand, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure connection between your local network (office) and a remote network (like your VPC in the cloud). It's like a secure tunnel that enables secure communication between your office and cloud resources.
