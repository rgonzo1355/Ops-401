# Web Application Threat Modeling

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Threat Modeling Explanation
**Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.**
- Threat modeling is like planning for a road trip. Before embarking on a journey, you identify potential risks and plan how to mitigate them. For example, consider the weather conditions, traffic, and roadblocks. Similarly, in threat modeling for web applications, you identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, or injection attacks, and plan security measures to protect against them.

### Organizing Threat Modeling
**What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?**
- The four questions that can help us organize threat modeling are:
  1. **What are we building?** - Identify the application's assets, components, and functionalities.
  2. **What can go wrong?** - Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities affecting the application's security.
  3. **What are we going to do about it?** - Develop strategies and countermeasures to mitigate identified risks and threats.
  4. **Did we do a good enough job?** - Evaluate the effectiveness of the security measures and continuously improve the threat modeling process.

### Benefits of Threat Modeling
**You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?**
- As the project lead, I would explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the team by emphasizing its role in proactively identifying and addressing security risks early in the development lifecycle. Threat modeling helps us:
  - Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
  - Prioritize security measures and allocate resources effectively to address the most critical risks.
  - Improve overall security posture and build trust with stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to security.
  - Reduce the likelihood of security incidents and minimize the impact of successful attacks on the application and its users.
