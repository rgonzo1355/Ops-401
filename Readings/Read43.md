# Sniffing and Evasion

## Reading

### What is a Sniffing Attack in System Hacking?
A sniffing attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts and monitors network traffic to capture sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential data, as it travels across the network. 

### Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend through the postal service. A sniffer would be like someone secretly opening the letter while it's on its way to your friend's house, reading its contents, and then sealing it back up so your friend doesn't know it was tampered with. In the cyber world, this is done with electronic communications traveling over networks instead of physical letters.

### What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
1. **Passive Sniffing:** In passive sniffing, the attacker only listens to the traffic passing through the network without actively injecting any packets. Pros: It's harder to detect and less likely to disrupt network operations. Cons: It's limited to capturing unencrypted data.
2. **Active Sniffing:** In active sniffing, the attacker actively injects packets into the network to capture and analyze traffic. Pros: It can capture both encrypted and unencrypted data. Cons: It's more likely to be detected and can potentially disrupt network operations.

### How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
Encryption scrambles the data being transmitted over the network into an unreadable format, making it difficult for sniffers to decipher the contents of the communication even if they intercept it. This protects sensitive information from being captured and exploited by attackers.
