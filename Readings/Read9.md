# What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## Reading and Discussion Points

### Definition of PKI
**What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?**
- PKI is a system that uses digital certificates and cryptographic keys to secure and manage the exchange of information over networks like the internet. It provides a framework for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data and communications.

### Components of PKI
**Name the three main components which make up PKI.**
- The three main components of PKI are:
  1. **Certificate Authority (CA):** Responsible for issuing digital certificates.
  2. **Registration Authority (RA):** Assists in the verification and registration of users requesting certificates.
  3. **Public and Private Key Pairs:** Each user has a pair of keys for encryption and decryption.

### Explaining PKI's Role to a Non-Technical Friend
**How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server?**
- PKI is like a digital ID system for the internet. When you connect to a secure website, PKI ensures that the data sent between your browser and the website is encrypted and can only be read by the right parties. It's like having a secret code that only you and the website understand, keeping your information safe.

### Main Weakness of PKI Architecture
**What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?**
- The main weakness of PKI is the reliance on centralized Certificate Authorities (CAs). If a CA is compromised or issues fraudulent certificates, it can undermine the trust and security of the entire PKI system.
