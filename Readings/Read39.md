## Understanding SQL Injection, Identification, and Prevention

### What is SQL injection?
- SQL injection is a cyber attack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications to manipulate a database by injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields or parameters.

### Can you give an example of how a hacker could use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access?
- An attacker could input a malicious SQL payload into a login form to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application's backend systems.

- Use parameterized queries, input validation and sanitization, least privilege principle, and web application firewalls to prevent SQL injection attacks.
